### Homepage

The homepage is a simple single page that provides an overview of the CloudTAK product suite, including links to the documentation for each component.

This can be viewed directly by opening the index.html file in your browser, or for development purposes, you can run a local server with auto-refresh to view it

To build locally run:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run serve
```
